      title: "1.0 The meaning of \"meaning\"",
      content: "There would be no languages if there were no expressions (words, phrases, sentences, etc.). Nothing meaningless is an expression. For this reason, the concept of an expression must be understood in terms of the concept of meaning, the same therefore being true of the concept of language.\n\nBut it isn't much use to be told that words and sentences \"have meanings,\" since the word \"meaning\" has three different meanings, and only one of these directly relates to the nature of language.\n\n**Meaning #1: The evidential meaning of \"meaning\"**\n\nIn some cases, to say that x \"means\" y is to say that x is evidence of y—that x and y are causally interrelated in such a way that, given x, it can reasonably be inferred that y. \"Smith's hacking cough means that he has a violent lung infection\" means \"Smith's hacking cough is evidence that he has a violent lung infection.\" And the latter means that coughs like Smith's are causally connected to violent lung infections in such a way that it may reasonably be inferred that Smith has a violent lung infection.\n\nSmith's violent lung infection is a cause of Smith's hacking cough. But for x to be evidence of y, it is neither necessary nor sufficient that y cause x. Why isn't it necessary? First of all, causes can be evidence of their own effects. (Bill's current drunkenness is evidence of a poor performance on his upcoming economics exam.) Second, if some event or state of affairs z is a cause of both x and y, then x can be evidence of y without being a cause or an effect of y.\n\nWhy isn't it sufficient? Given only that the cause of Bill's failing was that he was drunk, we can't infer from the fact that he failed that he was drunk. There are many reasons why a person may fail a test. Supposing that y caused x to occur, x is evidence of y only if it can't reasonably be supposed that anything other than y was the cause.\n\n**Meaning #2: The psychological meaning of \"meaning\"**\n\nWhen we use sentences, we mean things by them. Meaning in this sense is a psychological notion. You tell me that Sally is the most wonderful, decent person you've ever known. I respond by saying \"things aren't always as they seem.\" What I mean is that Sally is devious. In other words, my intention in making this statement is to say that Sally is devious. Given that intentions are psychological entities, meaning in this sense is obviously a psychological notion.\n\n**Meaning #3: The linguistic meaning of \"meaning\"**\n\nThe sentence \"snow is white\" says something about something; it attributes the property of being white to snow. Therefore, it means that snow is white. This kind of meaning is in a class by itself; it isn't identical with either of the two kinds mentioned so far; and there isn't any obvious way to understand it in terms of them."

      title: "1.2-1.3 Why Linguistic Meaning is Distinct",
      content: "**1.2 Why Meaning #3 ≠ Meaning #2**\n\nSome philosophers and linguists have held that for \"Snow is white\" to mean that snow is white is for it to be the case that, in uttering \"snow is white,\" what people mean is that snow is white. This view, duly generalized, is that for a sentence S to have meaning M is for it to be the case that, in uttering S, people mean M.\n\nThis position is false. There are many sentences that have determinate meanings even though they've never been uttered before and, therefore, no one as of yet has ever meant anything by them. The sentence \"The cube root of three is Sir Lawrence Olivier's favorite irrational number between one and four\" has a determinate meaning, even though that sentence probably has never been uttered. Thus, meaning in the linguistic sense is not in all cases identical with meaning in the psychological sense.\n\nBut a stronger point is warranted. Let's say that P1 and P2 are the propositions meant by two different sentences, respectively. In saying that sentence (1) means P1 and that sentence (2) means P2, we are not using the word \"means\" equivocally. Both occurrences of \"means\" denote the same relationship. Thus, the relationship that (1) bears to its meaning is the same as the relationship that (2) bears to its meaning.\n\nPsychological meaning presupposes linguistic meaning. What a person means when uttering a given sentence is a function of, among other things, his beliefs as to what that sentence already means. You must believe that \"snow is white\" means snow is white if, intending to speak sincerely and literally, you say \"snow is white\" with the intention of getting it across that snow is white. If you think that \"snow is white\" means grass is green, you cannot, if your intention is to speak sincerely and literally, believe that \"snow is white\" means snow is white.\n\nOf course, you could know full well what \"snow is white\" in fact means, but use that sentence to get across something that has nothing to do with the color of snow. But whatever the message is that, in uttering a certain sentence, you wish to convey, you must believe that message to have some kind of relationship to the one meant by that sentence itself. Furthermore, if you are to succeed in saying what it is you wish to say, what you believe to be meant by the sentence you are using must be right.\n\nThus, setting aside defective utterances, one cannot, in uttering a given sentence, mean anything by it unless one knows what it already means. So meaning in the psychological sense is parasitic on meaning in the linguistic sense, and the two kinds of meaning are therefore entirely distinct.\n\n**1.3 Why Meaning #3 ≠ Meaning #1**\n\nThe sense in which \"snow is white\" means that snow is white isn't comparable to the sense in which smoke means fire. The fact that smoke means fire has nothing to do with conventions on the part of human beings. But the fact that \"snow is white\" means what it does is, at least in part, a matter of convention. It's a matter of convention that \"snow\" doesn't refer to grass and, therefore, that \"snow is white\" doesn't mean that grass is white; it's a matter of convention that \"white\" doesn't mean green and, therefore, that \"snow is white\" doesn't mean that snow is green.\n\nAlthough the whiteness of snow sometimes causes people to say \"snow is white,\" it doesn't do so in the way that fire causes there to be smoke. Fire happens; smoke happens as a result. The presence of smoke doesn't embody any judgment about anything. But, when caused by the whiteness of snow, utterances of \"snow is white\" do embody judgments of various kinds. People see or otherwise come to believe that snow is white; and, since they know the relevant linguistic rules, they know that, were they to say, \"snow is white,\" they would be making a correct statement.\n\nThus, utterances of \"snow is white\" embody judgments about the color of snow and about how, linguistic conventions being what they are, one can report the color of snow. Also, people don't say everything that occurs to them. Before deciding to utter a given sentence, people typically make context-based judgments about the appropriateness of uttering that sentence. So various judgments—about snow, about language, and about human psychology—are involved in the causal connection between the whiteness of snow and a given person's saying \"snow is white.\" There is thus a normative dimension to language use that is absent where purely natural, non-conventional cause-effect relations are concerned."

      title: "2.0-2.1 Sentences as Proposition-Isomorphs",
      content: "**2.0 Sentences as proposition-isomorphs**\n\nThe meaning of a true or false sentence is a proposition. Propositions are not themselves sentences. That is why different sentences (e.g., \"schnee ist weiss\" and \"snow is white\") can express the same proposition.\n\nPropositions, when true, are truths. Thus, propositions have existed as long as there have been truths; which means that they've existed as long as there has been anything and, consequently, that propositions are not creations of human beings.\n\nThough distinct from the sentences that express them, propositions are structurally similar to them. Two otherwise dissimilar sentences can share the word \"John.\" \"John loves Mary\" and \"Sally punched John\" are two such sentences. The meanings of those sentences obviously have something in common corresponding to the fact that they share the word \"John.\" Since they share no other constituents, the thing meant by \"John\" must be capable of moving on its own from sentence-meaning to sentence-meaning.\n\nThis would not be the case if the thing meant by \"John\" in the proposition meant by \"John loves Mary\" were incapable of being disengaged from the things meant by \"loves\" and \"Mary.\" It follows that propositions consist of discrete parts; it also follows that those discrete parts correspond to discrete parts of the sentences that express them. Taken together, these two points entail that sentences are structurally like the propositions they express.\n\n**2.1 Propositions as digital structures**\n\nGiven that propositions consist of discrete, isolable entities, it follows that, like sentences and unlike visual perceptions and photographs, propositions are digital structures. The sentence \"Sally punched Bob\" has a unique decomposition into certain \"minimal units of significance,\" or \"morphemes,\" these being \"Sally,\" \"Bob,\" etc. Given what we said in Section 2.0, it follows that something similar is true of the corresponding proposition. Sentences and propositions are digital structures, meaning that they have unique breakdowns into minimal significant units.\n\nA visual perception of Sally punching Bob doesn't have a structure comparable to that of \"Sally punched Bob\" or any other sentence. Unlike sentences, perceptions don't have to decompose into minimal significant units. Visual perceptions, unlike sentences and propositions, therefore have non-digital or analogue structures. Given that at least some thought involves the processing of perceptual information, it follows that thought at least sometimes has a structure very different from language."

      title: "3.0 The Three Branches of Philosophy of Language",
      content: "The study of language is typically divided into three sub-disciplines—semantics, syntax, and pragmatics. In addition to denoting a branch of linguistic study, each of these three words denotes a dimension of language. So \"semantics\" refers to a certain discipline and also to a feature of expressions, the same being true of the other two expressions.\n\n**3.1 Semantics**\n\nThe discipline of semantics attempts to make it clear what our utterances literally mean. It has no interest in what is conveyed through suggestion or innuendo.\n\nIf a disappointed boss says to a substandard employee, \"it might not be a bad idea for you to start thinking about finding a new position,\" the literal meaning of his utterance is quite innocuous. But the message that is being sent is not innocuous—that message is: you're fired; you're a disgrace; go away; etc. The utterance's semantic content coincides with its literal (innocuous) meaning.\n\n**3.2 Pragmatics**\n\nPragmatics studies the use of language. Sometimes language is used literally. Asked whether I'm over thirty years of age, I say \"yes, I'm over thirty years of age.\" What I mean coincides with what my utterance literally means.\n\nLanguage is often used non-literally. If, while addressing a pan-handler, I say \"you've made a fine life for yourself,\" what I mean is the antithesis of what my utterance means. But usually the propositions literally meant by our utterances are neither opposed to, nor exhaustive of, the propositions we wish to affirm in producing those utterances. Asked whether there's a place to get food, I say \"there's a McDonalds down the road.\" The proposition I'm affirming is: there is a nearby place to get food, the reason being that there's a McDonalds down the road. Thus, the proposition literally meant by my utterance is only a part of what it is that I'm saying. Thus, what a sentence literally means is only one of many factors governing what it is used to mean. The discipline of pragmatics tries to identify the remaining factors.\n\n**3.3 Syntax**\n\nThe discipline of syntax studies the structures of the meanings of complex expressions. A complex expression is one that consists of other expressions. (Thus, \"the man who ate my cookie\" is a complex expression, since it consists of \"man,\" \"ate,\" etc., each of which is meaningful. By contrast, \"red\" is not a complex expression, since it doesn't have any meaningful proper parts.) The discipline of syntax tries to make it clear how the meanings of complex expressions depend on those of their parts.\n\nThus, the discipline of syntax doesn't study the meanings of complex expressions per se. It studies the relationships that such meanings have to those of their constituents. Consider the sentence \"Sally hates Bob.\" The word \"hates\" occurs in that sentence. If that occurrence is replaced with an occurrence of \"loves\" or \"is amused by,\" the resulting sentence has a very different meaning from the first. This shows that what \"Sally hates Bob\" means depends on what \"hates\" means.\n\nThe discipline of syntax studies the relation that the meanings of complex expressions bear to the meanings of the simple expressions composing them. Thus, syntax doesn't study the semantics (meanings) of complex expressions. It studies the structures of the semantics of complex expressions. Syntax studies semantic structure."

      title: "4.0 The Need for the Discipline of Semantics",
      content: "Even though we all know what is meant by \"John wants to catch a 20-pound striped bass,\" we don't know what it is that we know in knowing this. Semanticists supply us with the missing metaknowledge.\n\nConsider the sentence \"John wants to punch Bob.\" This sentence attributes a certain property to John—that of wanting to punch Bob. Given that \"John wants to catch a 20-pound striped bass\" and \"John wants to punch Bob\" are grammatically isomorphic, it's natural to assume that there exists some 20-pound striped bass x such that the proposition expressed by the first sentence is: John wants to catch x.\n\nBut this isn't the right analysis. There isn't some one fish such that, if the desire ascribed to John is to be gratified, John must catch that very fish. There is thus no fish x such that, if the sentence is to be true, John must want to catch x.\n\nThe meaning of \"John wants to catch a 20-pound striped bass\" is: John wants it to be the case that: there exists some fish x such that x is a 20-pound striped bass and such that John catches x.\n\nThus, the sentence doesn't describe a relationship between John and some non-existent or quasi-existent fish. It affirms the existence of a relationship between John and a proposition. The proposition in question is one that, in English, is expressed by the sentence: \"There exists some fish x such that x is a 20-pound striped bass and such that John catches x.\"\n\nIf John's fishing-trip is a success, that proposition will be true; otherwise it will be false. But that proposition exists either way. But we still haven't solved the problem. In the analysis, the expression \"some fish\" occurs. Grammatically, that expression is a noun-phrase. But, unlike other noun-phrases, it doesn't refer to anything.\n\nBut to solve the problem, we need only reword the analysis. The needed rewording is this: The property of being a 20-pound striped bass that John catches is instantiated. The property of being such a fish exists. So the sentence, which seemed to be about a non-existent fish, is about an existent property. The analysis says of that property that it's instantiated. Thus, a complete analysis of the sentence is given by: John wants it to be the case that the property of being a 20-pound striped bass that John catches is instantiated.\n\nSo even though just about every English speaker understands the sentence, knowing what it is that one knows in understanding it isn't such a trivial thing.\n\n**Semantics needed to figure out what is literally meant and what is not**\n\nDespite everything just said, there is clearly a sense in which every English speaker knows what the sentence means. What the semanticist is doing in connection with it isn't comparable to what you (who, we'll assume, don't speak Spanish) are doing in connection with it when you tell a monolingual Spanish speaking friend of yours what it means. The semanticist is needed to clarify the structure of the meaning that the sentence is already known to have, but he isn't needed to identify that meaning. The semanticist isn't a translator. But there are many cases where the semanticist is needed to identify literal meaning. In fact, as paradoxical as it may sound, there are cases where he is needed to identify the meanings of sentences that are perfectly well understood.\n\nFirst of all, we must distinguish what is literally meant by an utterance from what it is that the speaker wishes to convey. Sometimes literal meaning is cloaked by the pre-semantic information through which it is grasped, and semanticists are needed to uncloak it."

      id: "semantic-rules",
      title: "5.0 The Nature of Semantic Rules",
      content: "The English language assigns a certain meaning to the sound \"that dog has rabies\"; and given the spectacle of a rabid dog, it furnishes one with a sentence with which to describe what one sees. In general, the English language assigns meanings to sentences and sentences to meanings. This is true of all languages. A language is a systematic way of pairing off sentences with meanings. Any rule that assigns a meaning to an expression is known as a \"semantic rule.\" Languages are sets of semantic rules.\n\n**5.1 An important subtlety**\n\nThere are a couple of subtle but, in some contexts, important inaccuracies in what I just said. First of all, something isn't a sentence until a meaning has been assigned to it. In a world where there were no animate beings, but in which the ink deposit \"1 + 1 = 2\" was formed out of twigs, that twig deposit wouldn't be an expression of any kind. That twig deposit would be an expression if and only if it were endowed with meaning. This shows that something has to have meaning in order to be an expression. Thus, expressions aren't assigned meanings. They already have them and don't need to be assigned them. Therefore a semantic rule can't be defined as a rule that assigns a meaning to an expression.\n\n**How meaning is assigned to hitherto meaningless entities**\n\nSemantic rules assign meanings to non-expressions. But which non-expressions? A story will give us the answer.\n\nYou and I want to invent a code that only we two know. We both know a guy whose real name is Larry. We decide that our code name for Larry is to be \"Ichabod.\" So what's going on is that we're creating a semantic rule: one to the effect that \"Ichabod\" is to pick out Larry. How exactly is this rule enacted?\n\nIn order to implement this rule, I say: Let's refer to Larry as \"Ichabod.\" The burst of noise that I produce is a sentence-token. And what you hear is some token of \"Ichabod\"—you do not, since one could not, hear the name type itself.\n\nWhen you hear this burst of noise, along with my proposal concerning our new name for Larry, you know that what I'm saying is to the effect that any other physical object that is similar in the relevant ways to this burst of noise is itself henceforth to refer to Larry. Thus, I am in effect proposing that all and only those bursts of noise that are similar, in the relevant respect, to this particular burst of noise are to refer to Larry. (By implication, I'm proposing the same thing mutatis mutandis to hold of all and only ink-deposits that, given certain conventions, are paired off with such bursts of noise.) The thing that, according to my proposal, is henceforth to pick out Larry is the thing of which all and only such bursts of noise are instances. That thing, like anything else of which there are instances, is a property. It is the property had in common by all and only bursts of noise of the relevant type.\n\nThat property doesn't (yet) have a meaning; it isn't (yet) an expression. It's a property that existed, and was instantiated, before any of its instances meant anything. So the semantic rule that I'm proposing we adopt assigns a referent to a property that does not itself have a meaning. The same thing mutatis mutandis holds of any other semantic rule.\n\nThus semantic rules assign meanings to properties of physical objects—to morphological or acoustical properties (in other words, to properties that a thing has in virtue of having a certain shape or sounding a certain way). A semantic rule is therefore something which assigns a meaning to a property, and language is a set of such rules."

      id: "functions-and-grice",
      title: "6.0 What Are Semantic Rules? Functions vs. Gricean Approaches",
      content: "**What are semantic rules?**\n\nMany believe that linguistic meaning is to be understood in function-theoretic terms—that, in other words, semantic rules are mathematical functions.\n\nLet us start by defining the word \"function.\" Given any pair of whole numbers, the expression \"+\" assigns exactly one whole number to that pair. In general, a function is a rule that, given some class of objects, assigns no more than one object to any given member of that class.\n\nAlthough the rule expressed by \"plus\" assigns the number 8 to the pair <4,4>, it doesn't assign that number to that pair in the way in which a person assigns a task to an underling. In the former case, the word \"assigns\" has a psychological meaning; in the latter, it has a non-psychological, purely logical meaning. A related point is that the rule that assigns 8 to <4,4> isn't a social rule, and it therefore isn't something that can be obeyed or disobeyed.\n\nAccording to the function-theoretic view, semantic rules are rules in the strictly logical sense; that is, they are mathematical functions. The semantic rule for \"Socrates\" is a function that assigns a certain individual (Socrates) to that word (or to occurrences thereof). The semantic rule for \"snow is white\" is a function that assigns truth-conditions to that utterance (or to occurrences thereof). And so on.\n\n**Why semantic rules are not functions**\n\nThe just-described view is false. The rule denoted by \"+\" has always existed and always will. Of course, the expression \"+\" hasn't always existed. But that's irrelevant, since things pre-exist the expressions we use to denote them. \"Socrates\" is an Anglicization of the name with which Socrates referred to himself. Since Socrates lived well before the English language came into existence, \"Socrates\" (the name, not the person) didn't come into existence until well after its referent went out of it.\n\nThe semantic rule that assigns Socrates to ink deposits having certain shapes would exist even if the English language had never come into existence. Like the rule denoted by \"+\", that rule has always existed, and always will. So has the rule that assigns Abraham Lincoln to such ink deposits. The mathematical function that assigns the proposition snow is white to ink deposits like the italicized one has always existed, as has the mathematical function that assigns the proposition all horses weigh 18,000 lbs to those same ink deposits.\n\nBut the English language hasn't always existed. Since the English language is a set of semantic rules, those semantic rules haven't always existed. Therefore, they are not mathematical functions.\n\nAlso, if the semantic rules of English were such functions, there would exist a language in which \"Socrates\" referred to Lincoln and in which \"snow is white\" meant all horses weigh 18,000 lbs, the reason being that the corresponding mathematical functions exist. But there is no such language.\n\nOf course, there could be such a language. And maybe there will be; maybe somebody will invent a code in which those things have those meanings. But right now they don't. Such a language is merely possible and, therefore, doesn't exist. Thus, semantic rules are not rules in the mathematical sense.\n\n**The Gricean approach**\n\nUnderstandably, many philosophers of language believe that semantic rules must be understood in psychological, not mathematical, terms. There are different versions of this view. I accept one version of it. But the version I accept bears little resemblance to the versions of it that are usually held, each of which is some variant of the view held by H.P. Grice.\n\nAccording to Grice (1957), for expression E to have literal meaning M is for it to be the case that, when they utter E, M is what they mean. So \"snow is white\" has the proposition snow is white for its literal meaning because what people generally mean when they say \"snow is white\" is that snow is white.\n\nPeople generally mean snow is white in uttering that expression. Literal meaning is to be understood in terms of speaker's meaning. That's the main idea. Neo-Griceans hold that, even though literal meaning cannot in all cases be identified with speaker's meaning, it is always, ultimately, to be understood in terms of it.\n\nWittgenstein (1958) advocated a version of this view. \"Roughly speaking,\" he said, \"meaning is use.\" Expressions mean what we use them to mean—they mean what we mean by them. Wittgenstein nowhere makes it clear what he means by the words \"roughly speaking.\" But it doesn't matter, since his statement isn't even roughly true. Literal meaning isn't identical with speaker's meaning and isn't to be understood in terms of it. It's the other way around.\n\n**More problems with the Gricean approach**\n\nIf Grice were right, the meaning of the sentence \"Smith is now living in France\" would be fixed by the intentions people have in using it. But its meaning is not fixed by those intentions. It is fixed by the meanings of its parts (\"Smith,\" \"France,\" etc.), together with the way those expressions are ordered in that sentence. The semantic and syntactic rules of English being what they are, the sentence would have its current meaning even if it had never been used. So whatever the intentions of people using that sentence are, those intentions do nothing in the way of assigning it that meaning. In general, Grice's view is inherently incapable of accommodating the fact that meaning is compositional.\n\n**Why Grice's theory is inconsistent with the normative nature of semantic rules**\n\nA billiard ball isn't right to move after being struck; it just does. The relevant scientific laws merely register that fact; they aren't normative—that is, they don't characterize it as good or bad. Unlike scientific laws, semantic rules are normative. If, intending to affirm that Smith is female, you say \"Smith is male,\" you've done something wrong. If Grice is right, literal meaning is speaker's meaning. This means that, if Grice were right, speaker's meaning wouldn't be accountable to existing semantic rules. Since it is, Grice is wrong."

      title: "7.0 The Psychological Reality of Semantic Rules",
      content: "One view as to the nature of semantic rules is that they are idealized descriptions of the activities of speakers. Proponents of this view seldom if ever identify the facts about speaker-behavior of which semantic rules are supposedly descriptions. The most natural assumption is that they are idealized descriptions of what people mean when they speak and write (etc.). If this assumption is right, then, given the points just made, the view in question is wrong.\n\nBut even if this isn't what proponents of this view have in mind, their view is very clearly wrong. If semantic rules are just idealizations of speaker-behavior, then speaker-behavior must pre-exist the semantic rules embodied in it. But if that's the case, then the activity described by semantic rules isn't guided by them. An awareness of those rules is no part of what leads people to say the things they do. Those rules are psychologically inert. They have no \"psychological reality.\" This view is held by Nathan Salmon (2007) and also by Scott Soames (2002).\n\nThis view is inconsistent with some obvious facts. I know that Smith is now living in France. Wanting to tell you this, I say: \"Smith is now living in France.\" Why do I choose this particular sentence? Because, first of all, I know the relevant semantic rules (viz. that \"Smith\" refers to Smith, that \"living\" refers to a certain property) and, secondly, because I believe that, given these facts about semantics, the sentence in question is the right one to express my belief. A knowledge of semantics underlies my speech-act and, by obvious extensions of these points, all non-defective speech-acts.\n\nAnother problem with the Salmon-Soames view is that it's inconsistent with the normative character of semantic rules. If semantic rules merely describe existing semantic activity, then that activity isn't answerable to semantic norms. It is; so the Salmon-Soames view is wrong.\n\n**Conceptual role semantics**\n\nA little while ago, we discussed Wittgenstein's claim that \"meaning is use,\" i.e., that for an expression to have a given meaning is for it to be used in a certain way. This doctrine is incoherent in many ways. We've already discussed one of those ways; now we'll discuss some of the others.\n\nExpressions have meanings. A meaningless burst of noise isn't an expression. If I cough or guffaw, the burst of noise I've produced doesn't have the sort of meaning had by bona fide expressions. It has, at most, meaning in irrelevant, purely evidential sense, e.g., the sense in which a cough may be evidence of a cold. Since anything that is a linguistic expression ipso facto has a meaning (in the relevant, linguistic sense), there are no expressions to be used before noises, ink-marks, etc., have been assigned meanings. So, since there can be no expression-use until after there is expression-meaning, it makes no sense at all to say that expression-use determines expression-meaning. \"Meaningful expression\" is a pleonasm. So, contrary to what Wittgenstein said, meaning isn't use.\n\nOf course, how a given expression is used may well assign it a new meaning. But there is all the difference in the world between saying: Expression E's having meaning M is causally determined by E's being used in such and such a manner, and: Expression E's having meaning M is identical with E's being used in such and such a manner.\n\nAn expression E's having meaning M cannot possibly be constituted by its being used in such and such a manner, since E isn't an expression and, therefore, isn't an expression to be used until it has a meaning.\n\nAccording to a doctrine known as \"conceptual role semantics\" (CRS), whose exponents include Hartry Field (1977) and Robert Brandom (1994), for an expression to have a given meaning is simply for it to be used in a certain way. But this isn't correct as we just saw.\n\nCRS is incoherent for reasons other than the one just given. According to that doctrine, what a sentence means is determined by what people infer from it and what people infer it from. Whereas commonsense holds that one infers \"an even number is less than five\" from \"two is less than five\" because the latter already has a given meaning, advocates of CRS say that, on the contrary, it's because people infer \"an even number is less than five\" and other similar statements from \"two is less than five\" that the latter has the meaning it has.\n\nThis is not a viable view. If we learn tomorrow that, contrary to what we previously thought, Aristotle wrote several plays, we'll infer \"somebody who wrote several plays wrote the Nichomachean Ethics\" from \"Aristotle wrote the Nichomachean Ethics.\" But it doesn't follow that \"Aristotle wrote the Nichomachean Ethics\" means somebody who wrote several plays wrote the Nichomachean Ethics. The meaning of that sentence hasn't changed just because our beliefs about Aristotle have changed."
