      title: "Introduction",
      content: "Before the 1929 Stock Market Crash, the nation's financial system was highly unregulated. This led to improprieties on the part of financial systems that in their turn caused the 1929 Crash. The Fed responded to the Stock Market Crash by tightening monetary policy, because of which the Crash led to a full-blown economic depression. The government counter-responded by enacting a number of regulations that, while allowing the economy to grow, prevented financial chicanery on the part of financial institutions, leading to a 75 year period of stability and prosperity.\n\nThe most important such regulatory provision was Glass-Steagall, which prohibited commercial banks from functioning as investment banks, thereby preventing banks from using customer funds to finance their own ventures. Beginning in the early 1980s, these regulations began to be dismantled. In 1999, Glass-Steagall was repealed; and in 2004, the derivatives market was deregulated. These measures, combined with many others of the same ilk, eliminated the firewalls put in place after the 1929 Crash.\n\nThis resulted in the 2001 Dot Bomb Crash, which was the result of banks investing in what turned out to be tech startups, and later in the 2008 Housing Crash, which was the result of banks investing in what turned out to be worthless derivatives contracts. In response to the 2008 Crisis, the government passed Dodd-Frank, which reinstated many of the provisions of Glass-Steagall."

      title: "1. Regulating Finance Before and During the Great Depression",
      content: "In the American colonies, finance was almost completely unregulated. There did not even exist banks until 1781. The first significant act of financial regulation in American history was the creation in 1789 of the Bank of the United States (BUS), the nation's first central bank. BUS performed much the same functions as today's central bank, better known as the Federal Reserve: it loaned money to the government (by buying government bonds); loaned money to regional banks; regulated lending between regional banks and between banks and their respective customers; and functioned, at least in principle, as a 'lender of last resort', meaning that it would guarantee loans issued by banks under its control.\n\nIn 1836, BUS's charter was not renewed, because many in power felt that it had a stranglehold on the nation's finances. The nation would not have another central bank until 1914. During this interim, the nation's finances were semi-unregulated, to the point where many banks, especially on the Western frontier, issued their own currency. Although the nation as a whole prospered during this period, there were several banking-related crises, many of them involving banks' having insufficient funds to cover customer withdrawals.\n\nBecause of these crises, the Federal Reserve was established in 1914, its purpose being to guarantee the solvency of regional banks, control interest rates, issue currency, and loan money to the government. The Fed's power was limited by the 1863 National Bank Act and the 1927 McFadden Act, which largely prohibited banks from being operated or owned across state lines."

      title: "2. The 1929 Crash and Regulatory Response",
      content: "The Fed's charter was renewed just prior to the 1929 Crash. When the crash hit, the Fed was seen, not unreasonably, as having failed to do its job of stabilizing the nation's financial system. The crash was caused by the bursting of a stock market bubble, coupled with the fact that commercial banks had invested customer-deposits in the stock market and had therefore lost those funds, leaving their customers with little or nothing.\n\nThis situation was compounded by the fact that in many cases those banks had borrowed money from other banks to buy into the market, with the result that the banks' creditors were bankrupted. This led to a massive wave of bank-foreclosures, which paralyzed the economy. Instead of trying to stem the tide of these foreclosures, the Fed decided not to intervene, its position being that these bank-failures, along with the ensuing business-failures, were the market undergoing a healthy correction.\n\nThe government responded by attempting to regulate away the systemic issues that led to the crash. This involved several measures, three of which are especially significant. First, the government established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which guarantees that bank-customers will not lose their funds in case of bank-insolvency. Second, the government created the Securities and Exchange Commission, which requires people and companies engaged in the sale of securities to operate with complete transparency. Third, and most importantly in this context, was the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibited commercial banks from engaging in investment banking activities, including investing with customer-deposits."

      title: "3. The Great Wave of Deregulation (1978-2004)",
      content: "A wave of deregulation began in the late 1970s. In Marquette vs. First of Omaha (1978), the Supreme Court ruled that, when charging interest, a national bank only had to comply with the usury laws of its home state, as opposed to its host state. In the 1980s, several acts were passed that deregulated the home loan industry. In 1980, the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act was passed, allowing thrift banks to charge higher interest rates than was previously allowed. In 1982, the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act allowed thrift banks to function as commercial banks and vice versa.\n\nThe passage of these two acts immediately led to a wave of thrift bank foreclosures, the so-called 'Savings and Loan Crisis' of the late 1980s; but deregulation nonetheless continued unabated. In 1994, Riegle-Neale passed, eliminating restrictions on interstate banking, effectively rescinding the 1865 National Bank Act and the 1927 McFadden Act. In 1996, the Fed decided that, Glass-Steagall notwithstanding, commercial banks could in fact engage in investment banking activities, so long as such activities generated no more than 5% of their gross revenue.\n\nIn 1998, Citicorp, a bank, merged with Travelers, an insurance company. Even though this merger violated Glass-Steagall, it occurred with the consent of the authorities, setting a clear precedent for further such violations. In 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act was passed, which repealed Glass Steagall entirely."

      title: "4. Commercial vs. Investment Banking",
      content: "The repeal of Glass-Steagall was deeply significant, owing to the profound differences between commercial and investment banking. Commercial banks store and loan money. Investment banks engage in highly complex large scale financial transactions. For example, they help companies merge; they raise capital for large corporate ventures; they underwrite initial public offerings; they help set up partnerships between the public and private sectors; and they trade securities in various different markets.\n\nTo these ends, investment banks use extremely complex financial instruments, such as credit default swaps, and sometimes even design such instruments. Investment banking activities are hard to understand, especially for non-investment bankers, and therefore hard to regulate effectively. With Glass-Steagall repealed, commercial banks could now invest customer deposits in ways that are both highly risky and highly complex and therefore difficult to scrutinize.\n\nIn 2000, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act (CFM) was passed, which deregulated the buying and selling of derivatives, which had previously been strictly overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CMFT). A derivative is a contract whose value is a function of the value of some other security. Most derivatives are highly leveraged and highly complex, making them difficult to understand and regulate. The deregulation of derivatives would prove to be a crucial factor in the 2008 financial crisis."

      title: "5. Consequences of Deregulation: The 2008 Financial Crisis",
      content: "The deregulation that began in the late 1970s culminated in the 2008 financial crisis, the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression. The crisis was precipitated by the collapse of the housing market, which was itself the result of banks' reckless lending practices and investment in complex derivatives tied to mortgages.\n\nWith Glass-Steagall repealed, commercial banks were able to invest customer deposits in mortgage-backed securities and other derivatives. These instruments were often poorly understood even by the banks that traded them, and their true risk was systematically underestimated. When the housing market collapsed, banks found themselves holding worthless assets, leading to a credit crunch that paralyzed the global economy.\n\nThe interconnectedness of the financial system, facilitated by deregulation, meant that the failure of one institution could quickly spread to others. Banks had grown \"too big to fail,\" meaning that their collapse would threaten the entire financial system. The government was forced to intervene with massive bailouts to prevent a complete economic collapse, socializing the losses while the profits had been privatized during the boom years."

      title: "6. Post-2008 Regulatory Measures: Dodd-Frank and Beyond",
      content: "In response to the 2008 crisis, the government passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010, which reinstated many of the provisions of Glass-Steagall. The act included several key provisions: the Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from proprietary trading; the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect consumers from predatory lending; enhanced regulation of derivatives; and increased capital requirements for banks.\n\nDodd-Frank has been effective at preventing many forms of misconduct on the part of banks and has made the financial system more stable. However, critics argue that it does not go far enough. Because the banking sector is now so large and concentrated, it can hurt the nation's economy without breaking the law—a problem that cannot easily be regulated away.\n\nThe debate over financial regulation continues today, with ongoing tensions between those who favor stricter oversight and those who argue that regulation stifles economic growth. The historical record suggests that periods of financial deregulation have consistently led to increased instability and crisis, while periods of appropriate regulation have fostered sustained economic growth and stability."

      id: "conclusion",
      title: "7. Conclusion: The Case for Financial Regulation",
      content: "The history of American financial regulation demonstrates a clear pattern: periods of deregulation lead to financial instability and economic crisis, while periods of appropriate regulation foster stability and prosperity. The 75-year period of stability following the Great Depression was not coincidental—it was the direct result of thoughtful financial regulation that prevented the kind of reckless speculation that had caused the 1929 crash.\n\nProponents of financial deregulation typically claim that they are defending \"the free market,\" arguing that the free market leads to wealth while regulation cripples the economy. However, this argument fails on its own terms. When financial markets are unregulated, capital becomes centralized and access to it is restricted. Financial regulations have historically decentralized access to capital: regulations prohibiting interstate banking decentralized banking and therefore decentralized the ability to loan money; by separating commercial and investment banking, Glass-Steagall prevented investment banks from investing with customer deposits and therefore kept those deposits in the hands of the depositors.\n\nBy decentralizing access to capital, financial regulations have kept the economy going, while financial deregulation has hindered the economy by centralizing access to capital. Thus, even by the standards of radical free market advocates, financial regulation has been a success. The evidence is clear: financial regulation has done more good than harm in the United States, and the arguments to the contrary not only fail but do so on their own terms."
