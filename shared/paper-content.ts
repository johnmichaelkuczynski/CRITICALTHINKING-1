      content: "1 The world is everything that is the case.\n\n1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.\n\n1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by these being all the facts.\n\n1.12 For the totality of facts determines both what is the case, and also all that is not the case.\n\n1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.\n\n1.2 The world divides into facts.\n\n1.21 Any one can either be the case or not be the case, and everything else remain the same.\n\nThe opening proposition of Wittgenstein's Tractatus establishes the fundamental metaphysical framework: the world consists not of things or objects, but of facts - states of affairs that obtain. This distinction is crucial to understanding the entire logical structure that follows.\n\nThe world is completely determined by the totality of facts, meaning that once all facts are established, everything about reality is fixed. Facts exist in 'logical space' - a conceptual framework that provides the structural possibilities for how things can be combined.\n\nThe independence principle (1.21) shows that facts are logically autonomous: any particular fact can obtain or fail to obtain without necessarily affecting other facts. This logical independence is fundamental to Wittgenstein's atomistic picture of reality."

      title: "2. Facts and Objects - The Substance of the World",
      content: "2 What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.\n\n2.01 An atomic fact is a combination of objects (entities, things).\n\n2.011 It is essential to a thing that it can be a constituent part of an atomic fact.\n\n2.012 In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing can occur in an atomic fact the possibility of that atomic fact must already be prejudged in the thing.\n\n2.02 The object is simple.\n\n2.021 Objects form the substance of the world. Therefore they cannot be compound.\n\n2.0211 If the world had no substance, then whether a proposition had sense would depend on whether another proposition was true.\n\n2.0212 It would then be impossible to form a picture of the world (true or false).\n\n2.022 It is clear that however different from the real one an imagined world may be, it must have something—a form—in common with the real world.\n\n2.023 This fixed form consists of the objects.\n\n2.024 Substance is what exists independently of what is the case.\n\nWittgenstein's atomic theory of reality emerges in these propositions. The world consists of atomic facts - the simplest possible combinations of objects that cannot be further decomposed. Objects are the ultimate simples that form the substance of reality.\n\nThe critical insight is that objects must be simple and unchanging to provide logical stability. If everything were complex and changeable, language could not have definite sense. Objects provide the fixed scaffolding that makes meaningful representation possible."

      content: "2.1 We make to ourselves pictures of facts.\n\n2.11 The picture presents the facts in logical space, the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.\n\n2.12 The picture is a model of reality.\n\n2.13 To the objects correspond in the picture the elements of the picture.\n\n2.141 The picture is a fact.\n\n2.15 That the elements of the picture are combined with one another in a definite way, represents that the things are so combined with one another.\n\n2.161 In the picture and the pictured there must be something identical in order that the one can be a picture of the other at all.\n\n2.17 What the picture must have in common with reality in order to be able to represent it after its manner—rightly or falsely—is its form of representation.\n\n3 The logical picture of the facts is the thought.\n\n3.001 \"An atomic fact is thinkable\"—means: we can imagine it.\n\n3.01 The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.\n\n3.02 The thought contains the possibility of the state of affairs which it thinks.\n\nThe picture theory of meaning is Wittgenstein's revolutionary account of how language relates to reality. Propositions are logical pictures that share the same logical form as the facts they represent.\n\nJust as a musical score shares logical structure with a symphony, or a map shares spatial relationships with territory, propositions must have the same logical multiplicity as the facts they depict. This isomorphism between language and reality makes representation possible."

      title: "4. Thought and Language - The Limits of Expression",
      content: "3.5 The applied, thought, propositional sign is the thought.\n\n4 The thought is the significant proposition.\n\n4.001 The totality of propositions is the language.\n\n4.002 Language disguises the thought; so that from the external form of the clothes one cannot infer the form of the thought they clothe, because the external form of the clothes is constructed with quite another object than to let the form of the body be recognized.\n\n4.003 Most propositions and questions that have been written about philosophical matters are not false, but senseless. We cannot, therefore, answer questions of this kind at all, but only state their senselessness.\n\n4.01 The proposition is a picture of reality. The proposition is a model of the reality as we think it is.\n\n4.021 The proposition is a picture of reality, for I know the state of affairs presented by it, if I understand the proposition.\n\n4.022 The proposition shows its sense. The proposition shows how things stand, if it is true. And it says, that they do so stand.\n\n4.024 To understand a proposition means to know what is the case, if it is true.\n\n4.027 It is essential to propositions, that they can communicate a new sense to us.\n\nWittgenstein here develops his critique of traditional philosophy. Most philosophical problems arise from misunderstanding the logic of language. We mistake grammatical form for logical form and attempt to say what can only be shown.\n\nThe proposition shows its sense by its logical structure, not by describing it. Understanding a proposition means grasping what would make it true, not knowing whether it actually is true."

      title: "5. Logic and Truth Functions - The Scaffolding of Language",
      content: "5 Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions. (An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)\n\n5.01 Elementary propositions are the truth-arguments of propositions.\n\n5.02 It is natural to confuse the arguments of functions with the indices of names. For I recognize the meaning from the argument just as much as from the index.\n\n5.1 Truth-functions can be ordered in series.\n\n5.101 The truth-functions of every number of elementary propositions can be written in a schema of the following kind: (TTFT)(p,q) or more explicitly: (TTFT)(p,q,r,s,...)\n\n5.11 If the truth-grounds which are common to a number of propositions are all the truth-grounds of some one proposition, then we say that the truth of this proposition follows from the truth of those propositions.\n\n5.12 In particular the truth of a proposition p follows from that of a proposition q, if all the truth-grounds of the latter are truth-grounds of the former.\n\n5.13 That the truth of one proposition follows from the truth of other propositions, we perceive from the structure of the propositions.\n\n5.14 If a proposition follows from another, then the latter says more than the former, the former less than the latter.\n\n5.15 If Tr is the number of the truth-grounds of the proposition \"r\", Trs the number of those truth-grounds of \"s\" which are at the same time truth-grounds of \"r\", then the proposition \"s\" gives to the proposition \"r\" the probability Trs : Tr.\n\nLogic provides the general form of propositions through truth-functional analysis. All meaningful propositions are either elementary propositions or truth-functions of elementary propositions. This reveals the hidden logical structure underlying ordinary language.\n\nThe truth-table method shows how complex propositions depend systematically on their elementary components. Logical inference becomes a matter of analyzing these truth-functional relationships."

      title: "6. Ethics and the Mystical - What Cannot Be Said",
      content: "6.4 All propositions are of equal value.\n\n6.41 The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world everything is as it is and happens as it does happen. In it there is no value—and if there were, it would be of no value.\n\n6.42 Hence also there can be no ethical propositions. Propositions cannot express anything higher.\n\n6.421 It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics are transcendental. (Ethics and aesthetics are one.)\n\n6.43 If good or bad willing changes the world, it can only change the limits of the world, not the facts; not the things that can be expressed in language. In brief, the world must thereby become quite another. It must so to speak wax or wane as a whole. The world of the happy is quite another than that of the unhappy.\n\n6.431 As in death, too, the world does not change, but ceases.\n\n6.4311 Death is not an event of life. Death is not lived through. If by eternity is understood not endless temporal duration but timelessness, then he lives eternally who lives in the present.\n\n6.44 Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is.\n\n6.45 The contemplation of the world sub specie aeterni is its contemplation as a limited whole. The feeling of the world as a limited whole is the mystical feeling.\n\n6.522 There is indeed the inexpressible. This shows itself; it is the mystical.\n\nThe ethical and mystical domain lies beyond the boundaries of meaningful language. Values, meaning, and the significance of existence cannot be stated in propositions because they concern the limits and existence of language itself, not facts within the world.\n\nWhat we feel as the meaning of life belongs to the mystical - it shows itself but cannot be said. Ethics and aesthetics are transcendental because they concern our attitude toward the world as a whole."

      title: "7. The Limits of Language - Whereof One Cannot Speak",
      content: "6.53 The right method of philosophy would be this. To say nothing except what can be said, i.e. the propositions of natural science, i.e. something that has nothing to do with philosophy: and then always, when someone else wished to say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to him that he had given no meaning to certain signs in his propositions. This method would be unsatisfying to the other—he would not have the feeling that we were teaching him philosophy—but it would be the only strictly correct method.\n\n6.54 My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.) He must surmount these propositions; then he sees the world rightly.\n\n7 Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.\n\nThe Tractatus concludes with its most famous proposition, which encapsulates the entire logical edifice. Having shown the limits of meaningful language, Wittgenstein reveals that his own propositions transgress these limits.\n\nThe ladder metaphor suggests that philosophical propositions serve a therapeutic purpose: they help us see the logical structure of language clearly, after which we can recognize them as attempts to say what can only be shown.\n\nThe final silence is not empty but full - it encompasses all that is most important: ethics, aesthetics, the meaning of life, and the mystical feeling of existence. These show themselves in life but cannot be captured in the propositions of language.\n\nTrue philosophical clarity comes not from answering metaphysical questions but from dissolving them by recognizing the limits of what can be meaningfully said. What lies beyond those limits is not nothing, but rather everything that makes life worth living."
