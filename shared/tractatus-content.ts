    content: `MR WITTGENSTEIN'S Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, whether or not it prove to give the ultimate truth on the matters with which it deals, certainly deserves, by its breadth and scope and profundity, to be considered an important event in the philosophical world. Starting from the principles of Symbolism and the relations which are necessary between words and things in any language, it applies the result of this inquiry to various departments of traditional philosophy, showing in each case how traditional philosophy and traditional solutions arise out of ignorance of the principles of Symbolism and out of misuse of language.

The logical structure of propositions and the nature of logical inference are first dealt with. Thence we pass successively to Theory of Knowledge, Principles of Physics, Ethics, and finally the Mystical (das Mystische).

In order to understand Mr Wittgenstein's book, it is necessary to realize what is the problem with which he is concerned. In the part of his theory which deals with Symbolism he is concerned with the conditions which would have to be fulfilled by a logically perfect language...

The essential business of language is to assert or deny facts. Given the syntax of a language, the meaning of a sentence is determinate as soon as the meaning of the component words is known. In order that a certain sentence should assert a certain fact there must, however the language may be constructed, be something in common between the structure of the sentence and the structure of the fact. This is perhaps the most fundamental thesis of Mr Wittgenstein's theory. That which has to be in common between the sentence and the fact cannot, so he contends, be itself in turn said in language. It can, in his phraseology, only be shown, not said, for whatever we may say will still need to have the same structure.`

    title: "Preface",
    content: `This book will perhaps only be understood by those who have themselves already thought the thoughts which are expressed in it—or similar thoughts. It is therefore not a text-book. Its object would be attained if there were one person who read it with understanding and to whom it afforded pleasure.

The book deals with the problems of philosophy and shows, as I believe, that the method of formulating these problems rests on the misunderstanding of the logic of our language. Its whole meaning could be summed up somewhat as follows: What can be said at all can be said clearly; and whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent.

The book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking, or rather—not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts; for, in order to draw a limit to thinking we should have to be able to think both sides of this limit (we should therefore have to be able to think what cannot be thought).

The limit can, therefore, only be drawn in language and what lies on the other side of the limit will be simply nonsense.`

      title: "2. Atomic Facts and Objects",
      content: `2        What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.
2.01     An atomic fact is a combination of objects (entities, things).
2.011    It is essential to a thing that it can be a constituent part of an atomic fact.
2.012    In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing can occur in an atomic fact the possibility of that atomic fact must already be prejudged in the thing.
2.0121   It would, so to speak, appear as an accident, when to a thing that could exist alone on its own account, subsequently a state of affairs could be made to fit.
         If things can occur in atomic facts, this possibility must already lie in them.
         (A logical entity cannot be merely possible. Logic treats of every possibility, and all possibilities are its facts.)
         Just as we cannot think of spatial objects at all apart from space, or temporal objects apart from time, so we cannot think of any object apart from the possibility of its connexion with other things.
         If I can think of an object in the context of an atomic fact, I cannot think of it apart from the possibility of this context.
2.02     The object is simple.
2.021    Objects form the substance of the world. Therefore they cannot be compound.
2.022    It is clear that however different from the real one an imagined world may be, it must have something—a form—in common with the real world.
2.023    This fixed form consists of the objects.
2.024    Substance is what exists independently of what is the case.
2.025    It is form and content.
2.026    Only if there are objects can there be a fixed form of the world.
2.027    The fixed, the existent and the object are one.
2.03     In the atomic fact objects hang one in another, like the members of a chain.`

      title: "3. Pictures and Thoughts",
      content: `2.1      We make to ourselves pictures of facts.
2.11     The picture presents the facts in logical space, the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.
2.12     The picture is a model of reality.
2.13     To the objects correspond in the picture the elements of the picture.
2.131    The elements of the picture stand, in the picture, for the objects.
2.14     The picture consists in the fact that its elements are combined with one another in a definite way.
2.141    The picture is a fact.
2.15     That the elements of the picture are combined with one another in a definite way, represents that the things are so combined with one another.
2.16     In order to be a picture a fact must have something in common with what it pictures.
2.17     What the picture must have in common with reality in order to be able to represent it after its manner—rightly or falsely—is its form of representation.
2.18     What every picture, of whatever form, must have in common with reality in order to be able to represent it at all—rightly or falsely—is the logical form, that is, the form of reality.
2.19     The logical picture can depict the world.

3        The logical picture of the facts is the thought.
3.001    "An atomic fact is thinkable"—means: we can imagine it.
3.01     The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.
3.02     The thought contains the possibility of the state of affairs which it thinks.
3.03     We cannot think anything illogical, for otherwise we should have to think illogically.`

      title: "4. Propositions and Language",
      content: `3.1      In the proposition the thought is expressed perceptibly through the senses.
3.11     We use the sensibly perceptible sign (sound or written sign, etc.) of the proposition as a projection of the possible state of affairs.
3.12     The sign through which we express the thought I call the propositional sign. And the proposition is the propositional sign in its projective relation to the world.
3.13     To the proposition belongs everything which belongs to the projection; but not what is projected.
         Therefore the possibility of what is projected but not this itself.
         In the proposition, therefore, its sense is not yet contained, but the possibility of expressing it.
         ("The content of a proposition" means the content of a significant proposition.)
         In the proposition the form of its sense is contained, but not its content.
3.14     The propositional sign consists in the fact that in it its elements, the words, are combined in a definite way.
         The propositional sign is a fact.
3.141    The proposition is not a mixture of words. (Just as the musical theme is not a mixture of tones.)
         The proposition is articulated.
3.142    Only facts can express a sense, a class of names cannot.
3.143    That the propositional sign is a fact is concealed by the ordinary form of expression, written or printed.
         For in the printed proposition, for example, the propositional sign does not appear essentially different from a word.

4        The thought is the significant proposition.
4.001    The totality of propositions is the language.
4.002    Man possesses the capacity of constructing languages, in which every sense can be expressed, without having an idea how and what each word means—just as one speaks without knowing how the single sounds are produced.`

      content: `4.01     The proposition is a picture of reality.
         The proposition is a model of the reality as we think it is.
4.011    At the first glance the proposition—say as it stands printed on paper—does not seem to be a picture of the reality of which it treats. But nor does the musical score appear at first sight to be a picture of a musical piece; nor does our phonetic spelling (letters) seem to be a picture of our spoken language.
         And yet these symbolisms prove to be pictures—even in the ordinary sense of the word—of what they represent.

5        Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions.
         (An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)
5.01     Elementary propositions are the truth-arguments of propositions.
5.02     It is natural to confuse the arguments of functions with the indices of names. For I recognize the meaning of the sign containing it from the argument just as much as from the index.
5.1      Truth-functions can be ordered in series.
         That is the foundation of the theory of probability.
5.11     If all the truth-grounds which are common to a number of propositions are at the same time truth-grounds of some one proposition, then we say that the truth of this proposition follows from the truth of those propositions.
5.12     In particular the truth of a proposition p follows from that of a proposition q, if all the truth-grounds of the latter are truth-grounds of the former.
5.121    The truth-grounds of q are contained in those of p; p follows from q.
5.13     That the truth of one proposition follows from the truth of other propositions, we perceive from the structure of the propositions.
5.131    If the truth of one proposition follows from the truth of others, this expresses itself in relations in which the forms of these propositions stand to one another, and we do not need to put them in these relations first by connecting them with one another in a proposition; on the contrary, the relations are internal, and exist as soon as, and by the very fact that, the propositions exist.`

      title: "6. Mathematics, Science, and the Will",
      content: `6        The general form of truth-function is: [p̄, ξ̄, N(ξ̄)].
         This is the general form of proposition.
6.001    This says nothing but that every proposition is the result of successive applications of the operation N(ξ̄) to the elementary propositions.
6.01     The general form of the operation N(ξ̄) is: (-----T)(ξ̄, . . . .) = (-----F)(ξ).
6.02     And thus we come to numbers: I define
         x = Ω⁰x Def. and Ω^v+1 x = Ω^v(Ωx) Def.
         So, according to these symbolic rules, we write the series x, Ω'x, Ω'+1'x, Ω'+1+1'x, . . . as: Ω⁰x, Ω¹x, Ω²x, Ω³x, . . . .

6.1      The propositions of logic are tautologies.
6.11     The propositions of logic therefore say nothing. (They are the analytical propositions.)
6.111    Theories which make a proposition of logic appear substantial are always false. One could e.g. believe that the words "true" and "false" signify two properties among other properties, and then it would appear as a remarkable fact that every proposition possessed one of these properties. This now by no means appears self-evident, no more than the proposition "All roses are either yellow or red" would seem remarkable even if it were true. Indeed our proposition now gets quite the character of a proposition of natural science and this is a certain symptom of its being wrongly conceived.
6.112    The right explanation of logical propositions is that they are neither true nor false but tautological.

6.3      Logical research means the investigation of all regularity. And outside logic all is accident.
6.31     The so-called law of induction cannot in any case be a logical law, for it is obviously a significant proposition.—And therefore it cannot be a law a priori either.
6.32     The law of causality is not a law but the form of a law.
6.321    "Law of causality" is a class name. And as in mechanics there are, for instance, minimum-laws, such as that of least action, so in physics there are causal laws, laws of the causality form.
6.33     We do not believe a priori in a law of conservation, but we know a priori the possibility of a logical form.
6.34     All propositions, such as the law of causation, the law of continuity in nature, the law of least expenditure in nature, etc. etc., all these are a priori intuitions of possible forms of the propositions of natural science.

6.4      All propositions are of equal value.
6.41     The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world everything is as it is and happens as it does happen. In it there is no value—and if there were, it would be of no value.
         If there is a value which is of value, it must lie outside all happening and being-so. For all happening and being-so is accidental.
         What makes it non-accidental cannot lie in the world, for otherwise this would again be accidental.
         It must lie outside the world.
6.42     Hence also there can be no ethical propositions. Propositions cannot express anything higher.
6.421    It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics are transcendental. (Ethics and æsthetics are one.)
6.43     If good or bad willing changes the world, it can only change the limits of the world, not the facts; not the things that can be expressed in language.
         In brief, the world must thereby become quite another. It must so to speak wax or wane as a whole.
         The world of the happy is quite another than that of the unhappy.
6.431    As in death, too, the world does not change, but ceases.
6.4311   Death is not an event of life. Death is not lived through.
         If by eternity is understood not endless temporal duration but timelessness, then he lives eternally who lives in the present.
         Our life is endless in the way that our visual field is without limit.`

      title: "7. The Mystical",
      content: `6.44     Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is.
6.45     The contemplation of the world sub specie aeterni is its contemplation as a limited whole.
         The feeling of the world as a limited whole is the mystical feeling.
6.5      For an answer which cannot be expressed the question too cannot be expressed.
         The riddle does not exist.
         If a question can be put at all, then it can also be answered.
6.51     Scepticism is not irrefutable, but palpably senseless, if it would doubt where a question cannot be asked.
         For doubt can only exist where there is a question; a question only where there is an answer, and this only where something can be said.
6.52     We feel that even if all possible scientific questions be answered, the problems of life have still not been touched at all. Of course there is then no question left, and just this is the answer.
6.521    The solution of the problem of life is seen in the vanishing of this problem.
         (Is not this the reason why men to whom after long doubting the sense of life became clear, could not then say wherein this sense consisted?)
6.522    There is indeed the inexpressible. This shows itself; it is the mystical.
6.53     The right method of philosophy would be this. To say nothing except what can be said, i.e. the propositions of natural science, i.e. something that has nothing to do with philosophy: and then always, when someone else wished to say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to him that he had given no meaning to certain signs in his propositions. This method would be unsatisfying to the other—he would not have the feeling that we were teaching him philosophy—but it would be the only strictly correct method.
6.54     My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.)
         He must surmount these propositions; then he sees the world rightly.

7        Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.`
