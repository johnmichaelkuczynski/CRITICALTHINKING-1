1.1    The world is the totality of facts, not of things.

1.11    The world is determined by the facts, and by their being all the facts.

1.12    For the totality of facts determines what is the case, and also whatever is not the case.

1.13    The facts in logical space are the world.

1.2    The world divides into facts.

1.21    Each item can be the case or not the case while everything else remains the same.`

      content: `2    What is the case—a fact—is the existence of states of affairs.

2.01    A state of affairs (a state of things) is a combination of objects (things).

2.011    It is essential to things that they should be possible constituents of states of affairs.

2.012    In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing can occur in a state of affairs, the possibility of the state of affairs must be written into the thing itself.

2.013    Each thing is, as it were, in a space of possible states of affairs. This space I can imagine empty, but I cannot imagine the thing without the space.

2.014    Objects contain the possibility of all situations.

2.02    Objects are simple.

2.021    Objects make up the substance of the world. That is why they cannot be composite.

2.022    It is obvious that an imagined world, however different it may be from the real one, must have something—a form—in common with it.

2.023    Objects are just what constitute this unalterable form.

2.024    Substance is what subsists independently of what is the case.`

      content: `3    A logical picture of facts is a thought.

3.001    "A state of affairs is thinkable": what this means is that we can picture it to ourselves.

3.01    The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.

3.02    A thought contains the possibility of the situation of which it is the thought. What is thinkable is possible too.

3.03    Thought can never be of anything illogical, since, if it were, we should have to think illogically.

3.031    It used to be said that God could create anything except what would be contrary to the laws of logic. The truth is that we could not say what an "illogical" world would look like.

3.032    It is as impossible to represent in language anything that "contradicts logic" as it is in geometry to represent by its coordinates a figure that contradicts the laws of space, or to give the coordinates of a point that does not exist.

3.1    In a proposition a thought finds an expression that can be perceived by the senses.

3.11    We use the perceptible sign of a proposition (spoken or written, etc.) as a projection of a possible situation.

3.12    I call the sign with which we express a thought a propositional sign. And a proposition is a propositional sign in its projective relation to the world.`

      title: "4. Thought and Language",
      content: `4    A thought is a proposition with a sense.

4.001    The totality of propositions is language.

4.002    Man possesses the ability to construct languages capable of expressing every sense, without having any idea how each word has meaning or what its meaning is—just as people speak without knowing how the individual sounds are produced.

4.003    Most of the propositions and questions to be found in philosophical works are not false but nonsensical. Consequently we cannot give any answer to questions of this kind, but can only point out that they are nonsensical. Most of the propositions and questions of philosophers arise from our failure to understand the logic of our language.

4.0031    All philosophy is a 'critique of language' (though not in Mauthner's sense). It was Russell's merit to have shown that the apparent logical form of a proposition need not be its real one.

4.01    A proposition is a picture of reality.

4.011    At first sight a proposition—one set out on the printed page, for example—does not seem to be a picture of the reality with which it is concerned. But neither do written notes seem at first sight to be a picture of musical piece; nor our phonetic notation (the alphabet) to be a picture of our speech.

4.012    It is obvious that a proposition of the form 'aRb' strikes us as a picture. In this case the sign is obviously a likeness of what is signified.`

      title: "5. Logic and Truth Functions",
      content: `5    A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions.

5.01    Elementary propositions are the truth-arguments of propositions.

5.02    The arguments of functions are readily confused with the indices of names. For both arguments and indices serve to distinguish the meaning, but the argument does so by its value, the index by its place.

5.1    Truth-functions can be arranged in series.

5.101    The truth-functions of a given number of elementary propositions can always be set out in a schema of the following kind:

5.11    If all the truth-arguments are true, then we call the truth-function a tautology; if they are all false, a contradiction.

5.12    In particular, the truth of a tautology is certain, the truth of a contradiction impossible, and the truth of a proposition is possible.

5.121    A tautology and a contradiction are not pictures of reality. They do not represent any possible situations. For the former admits all possible situations, and latter none.

5.13    When the truth of one proposition follows from the truth of others, we can see this from the structure of the propositions.

5.131    If the truth of one proposition follows from the truth of others, this finds expression in relations in which the forms of the propositions stand to one another: nor is it necessary for us to set up these relations between them, by combining them with one another in a single proposition; on the contrary, the relations are internal, and their existence is an immediate result of the existence of the propositions.`

      title: "6. Ethics and the Mystical",
      content: `6    The general form of a truth-function is [p̄, ξ̄, N(ξ̄)].

6.1    The propositions of logic are tautologies.

6.11    Therefore the propositions of logic say nothing. (They are the analytic propositions.)

6.111    Theories that make a proposition of logic appear to have content are always false. One might think, for example, that the words "true" and "false" signified two properties among other properties, and then it would seem to be a remarkable fact that every proposition possessed one of these properties. On this theory it seems to be anything but obvious, rather like saying 'All roses are either yellow or red', and there would be nothing tautological about this proposition.

6.12    The fact that the propositions of logic are tautologies shows the formal—logical—properties of language and the world.

6.13    Logic is not a body of doctrine, but a mirror-image of the world.

6.2    Mathematics is a logical method.

6.21    A proposition of mathematics does not express a thought.

6.22    The logic of the world, which is shown in tautologies by the propositions of logic, is shown in equations by mathematics.

6.3    The exploration of logic means the exploration of everything that is subject to law. And outside logic everything is accidental.

6.4    All propositions are of equal value.

6.41    The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world everything is as it is, and everything happens as it does happen: in it no value exists—and if it did exist, it would have no value.

6.42    So too it is impossible for there to be propositions of ethics.

6.421    It is clear that ethics cannot be put into words. Ethics is transcendental.`

      content: `7    What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.

6.5    When the answer cannot be put into words, neither can the question be put into words.

6.51    Scepticism is not irrefutable, but obviously nonsensical, when it tries to raise doubts where no questions can be asked.

6.52    We feel that even when all possible scientific questions have been answered, the problems of life remain completely untouched. Of course there are then no questions left, and this itself is the answer.

6.521    The solution of the problem of life is seen in the vanishing of the problem.

6.522    There are, indeed, things that cannot be put into words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is mystical.

6.53    The correct method in philosophy would really be the following: to say nothing except what can be said, i.e. propositions of natural science—i.e. something that has nothing to do with philosophy—and then, whenever someone else wanted to say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to him that he had failed to give a meaning to certain signs in his propositions.

6.54    My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used them—as steps—to climb up beyond them. (He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.)

Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.`
