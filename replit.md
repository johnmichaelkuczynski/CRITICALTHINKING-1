# Living Book: Incompleteness of Deductive Logic

## Overview

This is an interactive AI-augmented interface for exploring the academic paper "The Incompleteness of Deductive Logic: A Generalization of GÃ¶del's Theorem". The application transforms a static academic document into a dynamic, conversational learning experience with mathematical notation support and multiple AI model integration.

- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Math Rendering**: KaTeX for mathematical notation display

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API access
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Anthropic Claude API access
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: Email service configuration

### Production Configuration
- Node.js process serving bundled application
- PostgreSQL database for persistent storage
- Static file serving for frontend assets
- API routes for AI integration and document processing

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
- Chat interface should be much larger (made 420px wide)
- User input should be a large textarea, not small input field
- Email functionality should only appear when user clicks on a specific response, not as a persistent input field
- AI responses should be very short (3-4 sentences maximum) unless user specifically asks for elaboration
- Enter key should send messages (Shift+Enter for new lines)
