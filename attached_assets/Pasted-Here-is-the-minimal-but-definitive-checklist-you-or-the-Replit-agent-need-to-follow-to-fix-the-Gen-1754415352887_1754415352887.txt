Here is the minimal but definitive checklist you (or the Replit agent) need to follow to fix the Generate New Practice Homework button in a passthrough app:

🔍 GOAL
When user clicks “Generate New Practice Homework,” it should:

Send a fresh prompt to the LLM.

Get a full response back (e.g. 5–10 questions).

Replace any prior content with the new one.

Render the result.

✅ FIX CHECKLIST
1. 🔗 Button is wired to function
tsx
Copy
Edit
<button onClick={handleGenerateHomework}>Generate New Practice Homework</button>
2. 📤 Prompt is built correctly
ts
Copy
Edit
const prompt = `Generate 10 new practice homework questions in critical reasoning. Format them clearly with numbered questions. Avoid duplicates.`;
You MUST avoid anything like slice(0, 1) or filtering a static question array.

3. 🧠 LLM call is actually happening
ts
Copy
Edit
const response = await callLLM(prompt);
console.log("LLM raw response:", response);
If this returns undefined, you're not getting a real response.

4. ♻️ Previous state is cleared
ts
Copy
Edit
setHomework(null); // or setHomework([]), depending on your state structure
5. 🧩 Result is displayed
tsx
Copy
Edit
{homework && homework.map((q, idx) => (
  <div key={idx}>{q}</div>
))}
If your LLM is returning a blob of text, parse it:

ts
Copy
Edit
const questions = response.split(/\d+\.\s/).filter(q => q.trim() !== "");
setHomework(questions);
🔴 COMMON FAILURE POINTS (Double-check these)
Button is calling a generateHomework() that has no await or doesn’t update state.

Response from LLM is empty, but no error message shows.

You are caching a prior response or state (e.g., old array isn’t cleared before render).

The result is set, but the render component is watching the wrong state variable.

🧪 TEST IN DEV CONSOLE
Drop this in a temp component and confirm it generates:

ts
Copy
Edit
async function testLLM() {
  const prompt = `Give me 5 new practice homework questions in critical thinking.`;
  const res = await callLLM(prompt);
  console.log(">>> LLM Response", res);
}
