 Modules Section
üî¥ Bug A: ‚ÄúShow Lecture Summary‚Äù Does Not Work
Probable cause: No LLM call is being made or it's being blocked/silently rejected.

Check:

Confirm onClick or onSubmit is wired to a function that:

Sends the selected lecture content or module to the LLM.

Awaits and displays the result in a state-bound component.

Ensure you're passing actual lecture content (not just a title) into the LLM request.

ts
Copy
Edit
// Diagnostic insert (pseudo-code)
console.log("Lecture content sent:", selectedLecture);
console.log("LLM response:", llmResponse);
üî¥ Bug B: ‚ÄúGenerate New Lecture‚Äù Does Not Work
Probable cause:

Either generateLecture() is not called,

Or the payload is malformed/empty when sent to the LLM.

Check:

Is there a default topic or module context being passed? If not, the LLM has nothing to generate from.

Check for undefined/null on the prompt builder.

ts
Copy
Edit
const prompt = `Generate a new lecture on ${selectedTopic || 'critical thinking foundations'}.`;
// fallback to a default topic ensures it doesn‚Äôt break
UI-level fallback: Add loading and error feedback states (e.g., "No content generated" or "Waiting for response...").

üîß 2. Practice Homework Section
üî¥ Bug: ‚ÄúGenerate New Practice Homework‚Äù Does Not Work
Probable cause:

Old state being reused (homework.length === 1).

LLM not being triggered because initial generation didn't occur or cached result is returned.

Check:

Disable all slice(0, 1) or hardcoded .length = 1 logic in the generator.

Ensure you are forcing a fresh prompt each time:

ts
Copy
Edit
const seed = Date.now(); // include timestamp to force unique context
const prompt = `Generate a new set of 10 critical thinking practice homework questions. Seed: ${seed}`;
Confirm button explicitly resets the previous state before triggering the LLM:

ts
Copy
Edit
setHomework([]);
await generateHomework(); // ensure fresh call
‚úÖ General Fix Protocol (Passthrough App Context)
LLM call audit: Wrap every LLM call in a try/catch block and log:

ts
Copy
Edit
try {
  const response = await callLLM(prompt);
  console.log("LLM output:", response);
} catch (err) {
  console.error("LLM failure:", err);
}
UI confirmation: Every button press should:

Clear old results

Visibly show loading

Render output or show "LLM returned empty" error

Force fresh prompts using a combination of:

Random seed

Timestamp

Shuffling internal modules or prepending unique tokens
